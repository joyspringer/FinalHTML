  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>I grew up in Oregon and spent a large part of my free time taking photos of the beautiful scenery on the coast. My family and I moved to North Dakota in 2017/2018. Since then, I've pursued my education at MSU and currently live in an apartment in Minot with my two cats: Rajah and Timone. <em>(Pictured Below)</em></p>

  title = "Timone & Rajah" /> 

  <p>A fundamental belief that I hold that fuels me and my work is the idea that memories are priceless. I strive to create a joyful experience for my clients and help provide tangible memories to cherish forever for them and their families. As far as my past experience in photography - I worked for Lifetouch Portraits in taking church directory photos, have had several photo sessions with friends and family, and have photographed a wedding. Right now my focus is on building my portfolio and my book of business. Please contact me to set up a session!</p>
